# RectangleIntersect
## OOP simple rectangle intersect using Bentleyâ€“Ottmann algorithm
Compute intersection of two rectangles and return the coordinates of the intersection points.

I tried a more in depth mathematical approach using line equations and intersections but it turns out that it cannot work if one of the line is vertical... Which is not convenient for most cases application.
I used a coordinate-based approach.
